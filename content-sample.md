# Become a Citizen

There are two ways to become a United States (U.S.) citizen – by birth or through naturalization.

      To become a citizen at birth, you must:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be born in the U.S or in certain territories or outlying possessions of the United States, that are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States</li>
      <li>Have a parent or parents who were citizens at the time of your birth</li>
      <li>If you were born outside the U.S., you must meet these <a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal-considerations/us-citizenship-laws-policies/citizenship-child-born-abroad.html">requirements</a> outlined by the U.S. Department of State</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Naturalization is the process by which U.S. citizenship is granted to a foreign citizen or national after he or she fulfills the requirements established by Congress in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). To become a citizen by naturalization, you must:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Apply for “derived” or “acquired” <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/us-citizenship/citizenship-through-parents">citizenship through&nbsp;parents</a>
