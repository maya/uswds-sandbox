lead: Acts of school and workplace violence, including both active shooter incidents and violent protests, threaten life safety and security, undermine public confidence, and emotionally devastate affected communities. IHEs should use these resources to build campus resilience by adequately preparing for and responding to violent incidents.

The resources in this section provide useful information related to School and Workplace Violence. The resources are organized according to the relevant [Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Mission Area](https://www.fema.gov/national-preparedness-goal)  within each category:

      Active Shooter Incident
    </button>
  </h2>
  <div id="a1" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
    <p>
      Active shooter incidents escalate quickly and evolve rapidly. While many conclude after a few short minutes, others stretch on for hours. IHEs should use these resources to protect their schools, safeguard the lives of their students, faculty, and staff, and facilitate the recovery process following this type of incident.

      Civil Unrest/Mass Protest
    </button>
  </h2>
  <div id="a2" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
    <p>
      Peaceful protests and demonstrations are commonplace across college and university campuses today. Most serve as a peaceful means of political and social engagement; however, IHEs do occasionally witness the violent escalation of these events. IHEs should use these resources to prepare for situations in which civil unrest devolves into criminality or violence and mitigate the subsequent loss of life and property.

      Soft Target/Crowded Places
    </button>
  </h2>
  <div id="a3" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
    <p>Soft targets include any person or thing that is relatively unprotected or vulnerable to a terrorist attack or an act of violence. Soft targets on college and university campuses today present a unique challenge given the large number of on- and off-campus populations, often resulting in crowded public areas. IHEs should use these resources to prepare for a potential soft target attack against crowded places.</p>

      U.S. Secret Service School Safety Research
    </button>
  </h2>
  <div id="a4" class="usa-accordion__content usa-prose">
    <p>Over the last 20 years, the U.S. Secret Service National Threat Assessment Center (NTAC) has conducted research, training, and consultation on threat assessment and the prevention of various forms of targeted violence. Following the tragedy at Columbine High School in April 1999, the Secret Service partnered with the Department of Education on two studies related to school safety.</p>
    <p>Published in 2002, the <a href="https://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/preventingattacksreport.pdf">Safe School Initiative</a> (SSI) (1.64MB PDF) examined 37 incidents of targeted violence that occurred at elementary and secondary schools to analyze the thinking and behavior of students who commit these attacks. The report, and accompanying guide, served as the impetus for establishing threat assessment programs in schools.</p>
    <p>In 2008, the agencies released the <a href="https://rems.ed.gov/docs/DOE_BystanderStudy.pdf">Bystander Study</a> (1.36MB PDF), a report that explored a key SSI finding that prior to most attacks, other students knew of the attackersâ€™ plans, yet most did not report it to an adult. The report highlighted the importance of creating safe school climates in which students are empowered to share their concerns. Since then, NTAC has continued to provide and update training to schools, law enforcement, and others on threat assessment and prevention practices.</p>
    <p>The tragic events of the February 14, 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, and the May 18, 2018 shooting at Santa Fe High School in Santa Fe, Texas, demonstrated the ongoing need to provide leadership in preventing future school attacks. On July 13, 2018, the NTAC released an operational guide that provides actionable steps that schools can take to develop comprehensive targeted violence prevention plans for conducting threat assessments in schools. This guide, titled <i><a href="/publication/enhancing-school-safety-using-threat-assessment-model">Enhancing School Safety Using a Threat Assessment Model</a></i>, provides an operational guide for preventing targeted school violence.</p>
